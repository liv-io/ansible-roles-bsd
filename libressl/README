DESCRIPTION

LibreSSL is an open-source implementation of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and
Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. It was forked from the OpenSSL
cryptographic software library in April 2014 as a response by OpenBSD developers
to the Heartbleed security vulnerability in OpenSSL, with the aim of refactoring
the OpenSSL code so as to provide a more secure implementation.

LibreSSL was forked from the OpenSSL library starting with the 1.0.1g branch
and will follow the security guidelines used elsewhere in the OpenBSD project.

For more information on the usage and available configuration options,
