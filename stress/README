DESCRIPTION

stress is not a benchmark, but is rather a tool designed to put given subsytems
under a specified load. Instances in which this is useful include those in which
a system administrator wishes to perform tuning activities, a kernel or libc
programmer wishes to evaluate denial of service possibilities, etc.

For more information on the usage and available configuration options,
