DESCRIPTION

The less utility is a text file browser that resembles more, but has more
capabilities. Less allows you to move backwards in the file as well as forwards.
Since less doesn't have to read the entire input file before it starts, less
starts up more quickly than text editors (for example, vi).

For more information on the usage and available configuration options,
consult the following sections.
