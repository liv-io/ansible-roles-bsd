DESCRIPTION

Ldns is a library to simplify implementation of recent DNS RFCs. The goal is to
allow depelopers to easily create software conforming to current RFCs and
experimental software for current Internet drafts. Because ldns is written in C
it should be a lot faster than Perl or other scripting languages.

For more information on the usage and available configuration options,
consult the following sections.
