DESCRIPTION

Scrub writes patterns on files or disk devices to make retrieving the data more
difficult. It operates in one of three modes: 1) the special file corresponding
to an entire disk is scrubbed and all data on it is destroyed; 2) a regular file
is scrubbed and only the data in the file (and optionally its name in the
directory entry) is destroyed; or 3) a regular file is created, expanded until
the file system is full, then scrubbed as in 2).

For more information on the usage and available configuration options,
consult the following sections.
