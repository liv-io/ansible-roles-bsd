DESCRIPTION

SysBench is a modular, cross-platform and multi-threaded benchmark tool for
evaluating OS parameters that are important for a system running a database
under intensive load.
The idea of this benchmark suite is to quickly get an impression about system
performance without setting up complex database benchmarks or even without
installing a database at all. Current features allow to test the following
system parameters:
 - file I/O performance
 - scheduler performance
 - memory allocation and transfer speed
 - POSIX threads implementation performance
 - database server performance (OLTP benchmark)

Primarily written for MySQL server benchmarking, SysBench will be further
extended to support multiple database backends, distributed benchmarks and
third-party plug-in modules.

For more information on the usage and available configuration options,
consult the following sections.
