DESCRIPTION

Ltrace is a debugging program which runs a specified command until the command
exits. While the command is executing, ltrace intercepts and records both the
dynamic library calls called by the executed process and the signals received by
the executed process. Ltrace can also intercept and print system calls executed
by the process.

For more information on the usage and available configuration options,
consult the following sections.
