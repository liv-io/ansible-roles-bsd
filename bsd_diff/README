DESCRIPTION

This is the BSD-licensed version of the well-known diff utility, obtained from
OpenBSD. It lacks some features of GNU diff. It is a proposed project idea to
replace the GNU diff with this one, but it needs to be completed first. Patches
are highly appreciated.

For more information on the usage and available configuration options,
consult the following sections.
