DESCRIPTION

VIM (VIsual editor iMproved) is an updated and improved version of the vi
editor. Vi was the first real screen-based editor for UNIX, and is still very
popular. VIM improves on vi by adding new features: multiple windows,
multi-level undo, block highlighting and more. The vim-enhanced package contains
a version of VIM with extra, recently introduced features like Python and Perl
interpreters.

For more information on the usage and available configuration options,
