DESCRIPTION

Mailx is an enhanced mail command, which provides the functionality of the POSIX
mailx command, as well as SysV mail and Berkeley Mail (from which it is
derived).
Additionally to the POSIX features, mailx can work with Maildir/ e-mail storage
format (as well as mailboxes), supports IMAP, POP3 and SMTP protocols (including
over SSL) to operate with remote hosts, handles mime types and different
charsets. There are a lot of other useful features, see mailx(1).
And as its ancient analogues, mailx can be used as a mail script language, both
for sending and receiving mail.
Besides the "mailx" command, this package provides "mail" and "Mail"
(which should be compatible with its predecessors from the mailx-8.x source),
as well as "nail" (the initial name of this project).

For more information on the usage and available configuration options,
