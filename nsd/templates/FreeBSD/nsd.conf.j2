	# %1 - first character of zone name, %2 second, %3 third.
	# %z - topleveldomain label of zone, %y, %x next labels in name.
	# if label or character does not exist you get a dot '.'.
	# for example "%s.zone" or "zones/%1/%2/%3/%s" or "secondary/%z/%s"
	#zonefile: "%s.zone"

	# may also allow zone transfer (for debug or other secondaries).
