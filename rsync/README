DESCRIPTION

Rsync uses a reliable algorithm to bring remote and host files into sync very
quickly. Rsync is fast because it just sends the differences in the files over
the network instead of sending the complete files. Rsync is often used as a very
powerful mirroring process or just as a more capable replacement for the rcp
command. A technical report which describes the rsync algorithm is included in
this package.

For more information on the usage and available configuration options,
consult the following sections.
